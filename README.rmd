###Project Information

This project aims to create an agent that learns to navigate a world and find trees.
Once a tree is found the objective is to then collect the wood resource from the tree.

Learning was performed using tabular-Q learning, a method of reinforcement learning that
applies weights to actions in different states to achieve a goal.
